at-random
	Similar to at, cron, and sleep, but with
	a random amount of time. It should be
	possible to select random disitribution
	and parameters. For example normal
	(Gaussian) disitribution with a specified
	expectation and a specified standard
	deviation.

pnf
	Plain-text News Feed, like RSS and Atom,
	but in plain-text. So that it is easy to
	write, easy to read, and easy to parse.

kmn
	Kill Me Now, logout everywhere. This is
	useful on a public machine. You may forget
	that you are also login on a TTY, (this
	happens,) and you would not want someone
	to find your TTY session (this happens
	too.)

(kpasswd + libpassphrase)
	kpasswd needs to be patched to use
	libpassphrase.
	Of course, everything should use
	libpassphrase, but kpasswd is extra
	important.

mktree
	find | mktree # = tree
	tree | mktree --untree # = find
	It should be possible to select indent
	and another delimiter than /.

unod
	Convert output from od (and similar
	data) to raw form.

vttrans
	A pts(4)-based and a pipe-based filter for
	translating unsupported (by the TTY) symbols
	to supported symbols. Too few, even important,
	programs restrict themself.

bus-dbus
	It is possible to make programs using dbus to
	instead use bus, without modifying those programs?

libescape
	Parse ANSI escape codes.
	Generate ANSI escape codes, primarily
	set of macros to make strings mroe readble
	for those not too familiar with escape codes.
